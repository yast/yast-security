    # * The main point is that injecting the configuration makes testing easier.
    # * Each rule decides which aspects of the configuration are relevant for them.

      # not require yast2-installation at RPM level to avoid cyclic dependencies. Note that
      # yast2-installation is always included in the installation image, but it could be missing
      # at building time. And missing yast2-installation in a running system should not be
      # relevant because the policies are only checked during the installation.
