## Description:		Information about your timezone and time
#
# Be aware that the time reference of the CMOS/HW clock has been
# forwarded to /etc/adjtime, the file used by hwclock(8),
# systemd(1), and the kernel as reference for the CMOS/HW clock.

## Description:		Write back system time if if already done by kernel
## Type:		list(no,yes)
#
# Is set to "yes" write back the system time to the hardware
# clock at reboot or shutdown eveb if this is done by the kernel
# in the so called ``Eleven Minute Mode''.
#
FORCE_SYSTOHC="no"
## Description:		HW clock is not able to use years outside 1994-1999.
## Type:		string
## Type:		list(yes,no)
#
# Indicates that the Hardware Clock is incapable of storing years
# outside the range 1994-1999.

## Description:		Overrides the default device file name
## Type:		string
#
# Overrides the default /dev file name, which is /dev/rtc on many

## Description:		Do or do not not run hwclock(8)
## Type:		list(yes,no,)
#
# Set this to yes if it is possible to access the hardware clock,
# or no if it is not.  On some platforms (s390 or xen) this may
# overwritten by the service its self.
#
USE_HWCLOCK="yes"
## Description:		Correct systematic drift of the HW clock
## Type:		list(yes,no,)
#
# Add or subtract time from the Hardware Clock to account for
# systematic drift since the last time the clock was set or
# adjusted. By default off as this can cause trouble.  For
# systems using localtime for HW clock this will ignored.
